        <h1>An Introduction to Tensorflow.js</h1>
        <p>Just a few months ago, Google launched Tensorflow.js. The JavaScript library is a cousin of the Python-based package.
          But, it introduces many additional capabilities that come with using a browser-friendly programming language. I
          plan to dive deeper into Tensorflow.js. Using the boston housing data set as an example, I'm setting out to provide
          a comparison of the Python and JavaScript versions of Tensorflow and show some cool capabilities that come with
          performing machine learning in the browser.
        </p>

      </div>

      <div class="col-lg-12">
        <h3>Boston Housing Data <i class="fa fa-link" href="boston_data.json"></i></h3>
        <p>We're going to dive into some data that was captured in the mid-1970's. The data set has 13 columns that describe
          the suburbs of Boston. The columns include things like the area's crime rate, proximity to jobs, and average number
          of rooms per household. Using these 13 features, we're going to build a model to predict the median home price
          of the area.</p>

        <pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
  // Get the data
  const bostonData = require("./boston_data.json")

  // Let's peek at the format of the data. Price is what we will be building our model to predict
  console.log(bostonData)
  // returns:
  // [
  //  {"crim":0.00632,"zn":18.0,"indus":2.31,"chas":0.0,"nox":0.538,"rm":6.575,"age":65.2,"dis":4.09,"rad":1.0, ..."price":24.0},

  // ...
  // ]</pre>
      </div>

      <div class="col-lg-12">
        <h3>Exploratory Analysis</h3>
        <p>Let's start by looking at each of the 13 features and their relationship with median home price. Notice any relationships?
          Are the features discrete, continous or binary variables?

      <div class="col-lg-12">
        <h3>Split, Train, Test</h3>

        <p>An important aspect to building a model is to use a training set. Our model will learn how to predict 
          the price of the Boston suburb based on the features in the training set. Once our model
          has been developed, we will then pass the 'unseen' testing data into the model and examine the models
          ability to predict using these new inputs. This helps us to assess if the model is too "overfit." 
          
          Follow the code below to see how the training and testing data is split.
        </p>

        <div class="col-sm-12 col-lg-7">
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
  // These arrays will hold our model ready data
  const trainingData = [];
  const testingData = [];

  // Define the size of the training set (e.g. 80%)
  const splitSize = .8 * bostonData.length

  // Use lodash.js to randomly shuffle the data, then chunk the
  // data into two arrays
  const shuffled = _.chunk(_.shuffle(bostonData), splitSize)
  console.log(shuffled)
  // returns: [Array(404), Array(102)]

  // Pass the shuffled data to the trainingData and testingData
  trainingData = shuffled[0]
  testingData = shuffled[1]
        </pre>

      <div class="col-lg-5"></div>
        <label class="caption" style="margin-top:20px">Here's a breakdown of the number of records in our training and testing sets</label>
        <div id="splitTrainBar"></div>
      </div>

      <div class="col-lg-12">
        <h3>Normalize the Data</h3>

        <p>At this point, it would be pretty easy to dive in and build our model. But, there's
          an important step we should take to help our model learn efficiently. Normalization is especially
          useful to apply to our data set because we have so many quanitative features with different scales. For example,
          the feature per capita crime rate ranges from 0 to 90 and nitric oxide concentration ranges from .37 to .87.
          Without applying normalization, our model would not only need to learn the relationship of each feature with the 
          outcome variable, it would also need to account for the scale of each feature. By applying normalization, we can control
          the scale, therefore reducing some computational power to building our model. More to come on that!
        </p>

        <p>So, how do we normalize the data? We'll need to convert each data point for a given feature to represent it's
          standard deviation from the mean. Let's see a few data points after normalization, then show the code that produced
          the normalized data.

        <h3>Build the Model</h3>
        <h4>Neural Networks</h4>
        <p>If you're new to neural networks, it might help you to watch this one minute explanation. Otherwise, press on to 
          learn the Tensorflow API.
        </p>

        <h4>Tensorflow's low-level and high-level APIs</h4>
        <p>At this point, our data is all prepped and ready to be fed to a model. But, we haven't created our model yet! 
          Within Tensorflow, there are two path's that we can follow to build a model. One path is called the low-level API, which allows
          us to explicitly create each of building blocks for the machine learning algorithim. The other path is called the high-level API. 
          This path allows us to use tensorflow's pre-defined, deep-learning algorithims. Using the high-level API, we still have the ability 
          to customize the model's parameters, such as the layers or loss function, which I'll explain soon. 
          For this demo, we will explore and apply the high-level API. 
        </p>

        <h4>Define the layers</h4>
      
        <p>The model that we are building will be a sequential model. This means that the outputs for one layer
          will be the inputs to the layer. In the final output layer, there will be one continous value In our model, we are going to define each of the layers and use a 
          Rectified Linear Unit activation function. 
        </p>

      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-offset-1 col-lg-9">  
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-js">

  // Build a sequential model.
  const model = tf.sequential();

  // First layer that directly receives the training data
  const hidden1 = tf.layers.dense({
    units: 64, // Ask a phd about this value...
    inputShape: [13], // We have 13 features
    activation: 'relu' // Rectified Linear Unit (again, phd)
  })
  model.add(hidden1)

  // Second layer that received hidden1 outputs
  const hidden2 = tf.layers.dense({
    units: 64,
    activation: 'relu'
  })
  model.add(hidden2)

  // Third and final layer that received hidden2 outputs
  // Outputs of this layer will be one continous value
  const output = tf.layers.dense({
    units: 1,
  })
  model.add(output)

      </div>

      <div class="col-lg-12">
        <h4>Choose a Loss Function and Optimizer</h4>
        <p>With all machine learning algorithims, we must have a loss function. A loss function is what our model 
          attempts to minimize as it assigns weights to each neuron in the model. Without the loss function, our model would not know what 
          metric to assess itself against in order to learn the appropriate weights.
        </p>
        
        <p>For our model, since the output will be a continous value, we can use the mean squared error (MSE) as our loss function. The 
          MSE approach aims to minimize the squared error of the predicted housing price value against the actual housing price value. 
          For our metrics, we'll also report the mean absolute error (MAE) since these values are easier to interpret.
        </p>

        <p>
          The method for how the model arrives at the best solution is by applying an optimizer. There are a few that we could choose from,
          but we'll use a the root mean square prop (RMSprop). RMSprop uses adaptive learning to speed up convergence.

        <h4>Create the training function</h4>

        <ul>
          <li>Model.fit is asynchronous, so we must wrap it in an asynchronous function</li>
          <li>We will pass the features (Xs) and outcomes (Ys) to the model</li>
          <li>We will specify the "epoch" property in the configuration. One epoch consists of a forward and backward pass of all the training data. 
            For our model, we'll keep it at 250</li>

        <h4>Converting the data into tensors</h4>
        <p>Last but not least, in order for the model to run, we must pass our data to it in 
          the form of tensors. Tensors are matrices. While that might sound intimidating,
          we don't need to know any matrices math in order to use them. We just need to know how 
          our data is structured and what it's shape is when transformed into a tensor.
